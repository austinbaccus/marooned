# Marooned - Project Vision

Marooned is a game where you play as a parrot. Your pirate crew has shipwrecked themselves on a remote Caribbean island, leaving them (and you) stranded! You must survive on the island against all manner of monsters and evil creatures and find the treasure deep in the island's jungle.

The gameplay will follow the documentation's outlines, but some changes are:

- The map's terrain will change the gameplay. Water, rocks, and jungle will inhibit your enemies' movements, so use it to your advantage.
- The camera in our game follows the player, and is not static.
- The player is able to shoot in any cardinal direction, adding another dimension to the gameplay.
